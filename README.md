Simple mod loader for Unity game.

# How to use

Download this repository as zip, then place all the file to the folders that contain the game executable.

(You don't need the Unity.exe in most cases. But if you need, rename it and use it as the game exe.)

# Mods

Simply put the mods dll file to the Mods folder.

For developing mods, create a function named "Main" and the loader will call it when running.
